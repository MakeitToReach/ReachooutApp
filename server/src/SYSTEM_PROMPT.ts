I'm focusing on crafting a JSON structure for website content, utilizing the \`GenericTemplateSchema\`. Initially, I'm concentrating on understanding how to translate user input into a well-defined website layout. The user wants me to act as an expert content writer; therefore, I'm focusing on refining a content strategy to provide engaging and meaningful material for a specific JSON structure.


**Defining Data Mapping**

I'm now focusing on mapping the user's input to the \`GenericTemplateSchema\` elements.  I'm devising strategies for extracting key information like name, role, skills, and projects from the user's description.  My goal is to ensure a perfect translation of the user's provided context to the required JSON structure.  I'm evaluating different parsing techniques to reliably identify these crucial data points within the text.


**Confirming Task Understanding**

I've grasped the core task: transforming user-provided text into a fully-populated JSON object according to a predefined \`GenericTemplateSchema\`. I will process user data to populate the website content. I'm ready to receive the input and get started.


**Affirming Task Readiness**

My understanding of the task is solidified. I'm prepared to receive the \`Website Data\` JSON object and the user's descriptive paragraph. I will meticulously extract relevant information from the provided text and populate the appropriate fields within the JSON structure to generate a fully formed output. I'm ready for the input.

About Me

I’m Rohit Sharma, a freelance advisor and builder driven by a passion for solving real-world problems with efficient, scalable, and modern solutions. Over the years, I’ve carved out a unique niche at the intersection of product, technology, and user experience — helping startups, independent creators, and growth-stage companies bring their ideas to life.

My journey as a freelancer has been diverse and hands-on. I’m someone who doesn’t just consult from the sidelines; I get into the trenches, understand the product deeply, and work closely with teams to ensure execution aligns with the vision. Whether it's launching a brand-new product, optimizing backend workflows, streamlining deployment pipelines, or enhancing frontend performance, I’ve had the opportunity to touch multiple layers of the product development lifecycle.
My Approach

What sets me apart is a strong bias toward shipping. I believe ideas hold value only when they reach real users. I work with a pragmatic mindset, focusing on creating minimum viable products (MVPs) quickly, iterating based on feedback, and ensuring that technology choices stay lean, maintainable, and aligned with business goals.

I also invest time in enabling teams. Many of my clients come back because I don’t just deliver solutions — I leave them with systems and documentation that they can own confidently after our engagement.
Selected Projects
ClipIt — Lightning Fast YouTube Video Clipper

One of my most exciting personal projects, ClipIt is a web application that allows users to instantly clip YouTube videos by specifying start and end times, with minimal processing delay. The backend, built in Go with yt-dlp and optimized for low-latency responses, streams clipped videos directly to the client, achieving near-real-time performance. I led the entire product stack — from server infrastructure on AWS EC2 to a seamless Next.js frontend experience. This project not only helped me sharpen my skills in video processing and optimization but also taught me a lot about scaling for performance.
GitHelp — Summarizing GitHub Repositories with AI

I worked on GitHelp, a browser extension that summarizes GitHub repositories using AI-powered summarization models. I architected the backend in Go to efficiently process repository files and generate LLM-ready JSON formats. The project involved building a serverless API layer, integrating directly into GitHub’s UI, and ensuring the extension could provide summaries without significantly affecting the browsing speed. It was a technically challenging build that required careful handling of API limits and data processing pipelines.
Peer-to-Peer File Transfer App

I collaborated with a product founder to build a web-based P2P file transfer solution where users could seamlessly share files between their phone and PC by scanning a QR code. I designed the backend with WebSocket-based signaling for real-time device pairing and explored various architectures, including direct peer connections and server-assisted transfers for reliability. The project demanded a nuanced understanding of browser capabilities, mobile limitations, and real-time communication.
Clients I’ve Worked With

I’ve worked with a variety of clients — from independent creators looking to automate niche workflows to early-stage startups trying to validate ideas quickly. Some notable collaborations include:

    Product Founders & Indie Hackers: I’ve partnered with solo entrepreneurs to help them build MVPs quickly, guiding both the technical stack and product direction. Many of these engagements focused on rapid prototyping and getting to market fast.

    Growing Tech Startups: I’ve been brought in to optimize server performance, set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, and refine cloud deployments on AWS. I’ve worked on modernizing legacy codebases, improving frontend performance, and enabling development teams with better documentation and tooling.

    Content Creators & Educators: I’ve helped creators develop custom automation tools to streamline content production workflows, including building YouTube-related tools and process optimizations using Python and serverless functions.

    Cross-functional Teams: In several engagements, I’ve worked alongside designers, backend developers, and product managers to ensure smooth cross-team collaboration and alignment between business goals and technical execution.

        text: `**1. Analyzing user data**

I've just started to analyze the user data, specifically Rohit Sharma's profile. I'm focusing on his name, role (freelance advisor and builder), and his core passion: solving real-world problems with efficient and scalable solutions. This information is key to understanding how to best structure the JSON object.


**Examining Project Details**

I'm now diving into the specifics of Rohit's projects.  ClipIt's focus on low-latency streaming is intriguing, and I see parallels with the P2P app's WebSocket signaling.  GitHelp's integration with the GitHub UI is also quite clever.  Each project provides valuable context for crafting an accurate JSON structure that highlights his skills.


**Structuring the JSON Object**

I'm now deep in the process of structuring the JSON object. My analysis has led me to focus on accurately representing Rohit's diverse skill set and projects within the provided website data structure. I'm focusing on ensuring the 'sections' array captures the essence of each project and his services. I have already begun mapping the data into the structure, focusing on the navbar and now the hero section.


**Mapping the Data**

I'm now focusing on mapping the user data into the website's structure. I've successfully populated the navbar and hero sections. The about section is being crafted to reflect Rohit's hands-on approach and focus on creating impactful solutions. Currently, the service section is being organized to highlight how Rohit's skills can help clients. I will also incorporate his contact information in a placeholder.


**Refining Project Sections**

I'm currently finalizing the project sections. I'm focusing on crafting concise descriptions for ClipIt, GitHelp, and the P2P app. The goal is to highlight their key features and technologies succinctly. I'm also preparing the data structure to include placeholders for contact info, ensuring a smooth handoff.


**Finalizing Project Descriptions**

I'm wrapping up the final edits to the project descriptions. I've adjusted the language to ensure each project is concisely represented. I am also making sure placeholders are in the right places.  Once the JSON structure is complete, I will create some realistic contact details to complete the object, ensuring it's fully populated.


**Refining JSON Output**

I'm now integrating the user data into the provided structure. I've populated the necessary fields, including the navbar, hero section, about section with custom stats, and project details. I've also disabled the irrelevant "team" section. Now, I'm focusing on the "client" section and preparing the contact section with some placeholder data to complete the initial JSON object.


**Mapping the Services Section**

I'm currently finalizing the mapping of the services section. I've successfully translated Rohit's offerings into clear and concise service descriptions, complete with appropriate icons. I'm focusing on ensuring these offerings directly resonate with his target clients and highlight his expertise. The section is organized and ready to be integrated into the final JSON output.


**Refining Contact Section**

I am now putting the finishing touches on the contact section. I've populated placeholder contact details, including a generic email and a placeholder phone number, to ensure a complete and functional JSON object. I've also incorporated a brief call-to-action text, inviting users to reach out. This marks a significant step towards finalizing the JSON structure.

\\n\\n**Creating Placeholder Client Logos**

I'm currently focusing on populating the "Client" section of the website structure. The user data doesn't include specific client logos, so I'm creating a set of placeholder images to represent the target audiences. I am using generic icons to represent Product Founders, Growing Tech Startups, and Content Creators. I'm ensuring these placeholders align with the website's design and maintain a professional aesthetic.


**Finalizing the JSON Structure**

I've completed the mapping of the user data into the website structure. The "Client" section now includes placeholder logos, and the contact section contains placeholder details. The JSON object is now fully populated, and I am ready to generate the final output. The services section is also integrated and refined to match the provided data.


**Crafting Placeholder Content**

I'm currently focused on creating placeholder client logos for the 'Client' section. Since specific logos aren't provided, I'm generating generic icons to represent the target audiences: Product Founders, Growing Tech Startups, and Content Creators. I'm ensuring these placeholder images align with the overall website design.


**Refining About and Hero Sections**

I'm now refining the 'about' and 'hero' sections. The hero's description and title are polished for a strong first impression. I've curated the 'about' section to reflect my hands-on approach and focus on impact, incorporating realistic statistics. Key skills are integrated, and I am now adjusting the about section.

About Me

Hi, I’m [Your Name], a freelance advisor and builder driven by a passion for solving real-world problems with efficient, scalable, and modern solutions. Over the years, I’ve carved out a unique niche at the intersection of product, technology, and user experience — helping startups, independent creators, and growth-stage companies bring their ideas to life.

My journey as a freelancer has been diverse and hands-on. I’m someone who doesn’t just consult from the sidelines; I get into the trenches, understand the product deeply, and work closely with teams to ensure execution aligns with the vision. Whether it's launching a brand-new product, optimizing backend workflows, streamlining deployment pipelines, or enhancing frontend performance, I’ve had the opportunity to touch multiple layers of the product development lifecycle.
My Approach

What sets me apart is a strong bias toward shipping. I believe ideas hold value only when they reach real users. I work with a pragmatic mindset, focusing on creating minimum viable products (MVPs) quickly, iterating based on feedback, and ensuring that technology choices stay lean, maintainable, and aligned with business goals.

I also invest time in enabling teams. Many of my clients come back because I don’t just deliver solutions — I leave them with systems and documentation that they can own confidently after our engagement.
Selected Projects
ClipIt — Lightning Fast YouTube Video Clipper

One of my most exciting personal projects, ClipIt is a web application that allows users to instantly clip YouTube videos by specifying start and end times, with minimal processing delay. The backend, built in Go with yt-dlp and optimized for low-latency responses, streams clipped videos directly to the client, achieving near-real-time performance. I led the entire product stack — from server infrastructure on AWS EC2 to a seamless Next.js frontend experience. This project not only helped me sharpen my skills in video processing and optimization but also taught me a lot about scaling for performance.
GitHelp — Summarizing GitHub Repositories with AI

I worked on GitHelp, a browser extension that summarizes GitHub repositories using AI-powered summarization models. I architected the backend in Go to efficiently process repository files and generate LLM-ready JSON formats. The project involved building a serverless API layer, integrating directly into GitHub’s UI, and ensuring the extension could provide summaries without significantly affecting the browsing speed. It was a technically challenging build that required careful handling of API limits and data processing pipelines.
Peer-to-Peer File Transfer App

I collaborated with a product founder to build a web-based P2P file transfer solution where users could seamlessly share files between their phone and PC by scanning a QR code. I designed the backend with WebSocket-based signaling for real-time device pairing and explored various architectures, including direct peer connections and server-assisted transfers for reliability. The project demanded a nuanced understanding of browser capabilities, mobile limitations, and real-time communication.
Clients I’ve Worked With

I’ve worked with a variety of clients — from independent creators looking to automate niche workflows to early-stage startups trying to validate ideas quickly. Some notable collaborations include:

    Product Founders & Indie Hackers: I’ve partnered with solo entrepreneurs to help them build MVPs quickly, guiding both the technical stack and product direction. Many of these engagements focused on rapid prototyping and getting to market fast.

    Growing Tech Startups: I’ve been brought in to optimize server performance, set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, and refine cloud deployments on AWS. I’ve worked on modernizing legacy codebases, improving frontend performance, and enabling development teams with better documentation and tooling.

    Content Creators & Educators: I’ve helped creators develop custom automation tools to streamline content production workflows, including building YouTube-related tools and process optimizations using Python and serverless functions.

    Cross-functional Teams: In several engagements, I’ve worked alongside designers, backend developers, and product managers to ensure smooth cross-team collaboration and alignment between business goals and technical execution.

        text: `**Generating the JSON Object**

I'm currently working on building a JSON object. I'm focusing on the \`Website Content Structure\` and \`User Data\` templates.  I've decided to standardize the placeholder name, replacing \`[Your Name]\` with "Alex Doe" for consistency in my output. This will allow for easier parsing of the resulting JSON.


**Analyzing Data Templates**

I've made good progress on the initial JSON object generation. Currently, I'm parsing both the \`Website Content Structure\` and \`User Data\` templates, paying close attention to the \`navbar\` section and other sections. I'm focusing on consistently replacing the placeholder "[Your Name]" with "Alex Doe" to streamline the process. The system is set up to handle missing data gracefully, keeping default values from the website structure if user input is absent. I'm considering sensible fallback options, especially for stats and contact details.


**Implementing the Data**

I've successfully mapped the 'navbar' and 'hero' sections, substituting "Alex Doe" where appropriate.  My current focus is on the 'about' section, specifically determining the title from the available user data. I'm exploring different options for the 'professions' array, carefully examining the provided description for relevant keywords. I'm also addressing the 'btnText' and 'btnLink' for more relevant CTAs.


**Mapping More Website Sections**

I'm now diving into the \`projects\` and \`footer\` sections, focusing on extracting relevant project titles and data. For the \`footer\`, I'm handling social links and contact information, relying on default values where needed. I'm replacing the placeholder name with "Alex Doe" in these sections too for consistency. My primary goal is to accurately translate the user's information into a JSON structure, adhering to all instructions. I am extracting relevant CTA text. The projects section is being mapped section by section to identify project names.


**Expanding the JSON Object**

I'm now fully immersed in the "projects" section. I've successfully populated details for "ClipIt," including description, button text, link, and category. I'm moving on to "GitHelp," aiming to extract its specific characteristics to enrich the object. The objective is still to ensure comprehensive JSON generation following the instructions and user data, including replacing "[Your Name]" with "Alex Doe" consistently.


**Structuring the Data Flow**

I'm now integrating the user data into the website structure section by section, starting with "navbar" and "hero." Replacing "[Your Name]" with "Alex Doe" is going smoothly. I'm focusing on "about" section details, like the appropriate title. I'm now generating "professions" according to the user's description. The objective remains accurate data mapping.

I've completed the implementation of the project details, and the data from "ClipIt" and "GitHelp" are completely implemented. I'm now implementing the peer-to-peer app. I'm carefully examining the content, determining the best description, and identifying categories. The goal is accurate and robust JSON generation.


**Constructing the "Projects" Section**

I'm currently working on the \`projects\` section, incorporating the details for "ClipIt," "GitHelp," and the peer-to-peer app. I've populated the necessary fields, including descriptions, button text, and links. Now, I'm focusing on assigning appropriate categories based on the technology used, ensuring a clear and organized presentation of each project.


**Constructing the "Footer" Section**

I'm now deep into the footer details. I'm focusing on the contact information, particularly the social media links. Since the data does not explicitly define what links to include, I will use default LinkedIn and GitHub for the social links.  For the copyright, I will set "[Alex Doe] - Portfolio" and also create a placeholder for the email, using "alex.doe@email.com".

I am generating the final JSON object, including the project section data, replacing  "[Your Name]" with "Alex Doe" where appropriate.


**Constructing the Footer**

I'm making progress on the footer. I've successfully implemented the contact info, defaulting to "[Alex Doe] - Portfolio" for copyright and "alex.doe@email.com" as a placeholder email. The social links are set as well, and everything is linked to the JSON object. All sections have been covered, and the object is ready for final testing and implementation.


**Mapping & Implementing User Data**

I've completed the mapping of the "navbar," "hero," and "about" sections, seamlessly integrating "Alex Doe" into relevant fields.  I've extracted key descriptions and professions, and  I'm now focusing on mapping the user's project details, and will move onto the  footer section. The project section will be completed following the information that has been provided.

I'm currently working on structuring a JSON response. My main challenge is merging the user's input, which has text with placeholders, into the predefined website structure. I'm focusing on crafting an efficient method to swap those placeholders with the right data from the text. I'm aiming for a dynamic and adaptable solution.


**Adjusting the Approach**

I'm now revising my JSON generation strategy. The recent update necessitates that I retain website structure data for sections without user-provided content. Instead of defaulting to "null," the original data must be preserved. I'm focusing on a conditional logic system, ensuring each section dynamically populates from either the user's text or the website structure. The initial focus is still hero \`description\` and \`professions\`, with "Alex Doe" to be used as a sample name.


**Refining the Mapping**

I'm now integrating the new guideline. Instead of 'null', I will retain the original structure data when user input is insufficient. I'm prioritizing the parsing of the sample text, to extract hero description, professions, and about content. Placeholder names for "[Your Name]" will be "Alex Doe". The statistics section will be populated using the original data, since no stats are supplied by the user. Next, I will begin building the object for the hero and about section, then handle the project data.


**Structuring the Services**

I'm now focusing on the services section, aiming to summarize the user-provided points into a concise format. The original data must be retained if there's no matching information from the user's text. I'm prioritizing the creation of three primary services, each encapsulating the key ideas from the input. I will then test the JSON output.


**Integrating the Logic**

I'm now incorporating a crucial rule: preserving original structure data where user input is absent. Instead of \`null\`, I will retain existing content for sections like \`team\`, \`gallery\`, etc., when the user's text lacks corresponding data. I'm focusing on parsing the user's text to populate \`hero\`, \`about\`, \`projects\`, and \`services\`. I will create placeholder names for "[Your Name]", defaulting to "Alex Doe".


**Structuring the Response**

I'm now focusing on filling in the website structure while adhering to the new guideline of preserving existing data where user input is absent. The process involves parsing the user text for hero descriptions, professions (e.g., "freelance advisor", "builder", "product"), and the about section content. I'll maintain the website structure for sections like \`team\`, \`gallery\`, and \`service-catalog\`, incorporating the updated content for hero, projects, and services accordingly.
